Problem solver at heart. Data detective by day. Probably planning my next hike or waiting for an F1 weekend.

I work at the intersection of **business, data, and machine learning**, turning complex datasets into practical product solutions that drive real impact. I’m currently pursuing my Master’s in Management Information Systems at **Texas A&M University**, Class of 2026, with a strong focus on statistical thinking, first principles design, and applied analytics.

My technical toolkit spans **Python, advanced SQL, machine learning, and data visualization**, but my real strength lies in connecting **people, process, and technology**. From building churn prediction models that improved customer lifetime value by 15 percent to optimizing database workflows that improved performance by 65 percent, I’m motivated by measurable outcomes.

I consistently dedicate **1.5 to 3 hours daily** to sharpening my craft:
1. 📊 Advanced SQL, probability, and machine learning fundamentals  
2. 🧠 Product thinking and first principles problem solving  
3. 🤖 Agentic AI systems and modern data platforms  
4. 🚀 Emerging technologies and business porcess design 

Outside of work and coursework, you’ll find me cheering for **McLaren on F1 weekends**, planning hiking and trekking trips, or diving into conversations about technology, products, and systems that scale.

I’m actively exploring opportunities in **Data Analytics, Product Management, and IT Consulting**, where I can apply my analytical mindset and collaborative approach to build meaningful products.

**Fun fact:** Much like F1 racing, I believe the best insights happen when technical rigor meets creative problem solving and sometimes you just need that leap of faith to cross the finish line first 🏁🏎️

Feel free to reach out if you want to talk data, AI, F1, or your next mountain adventure 🏔️
